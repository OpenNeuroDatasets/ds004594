This is the dataset associated with the in-review manuscript, "Novel approaches to functional lateralization: Assessing information in activity patterns across hemispheres and more accurately identifying structural homologues."

Included here are defaced structural scans and functional runs of subjects performing a match versus non-match judgment task on stimuli representing words, faces, quantities and numerals, and shapes.
